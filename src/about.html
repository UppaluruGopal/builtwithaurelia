            <h1>About Built With Aurelia</h1>
            <p>Built With Aurelia is a simplistic showcase of all the great things the Aurelia community are doing. Whether it be a website, mobile application or a plugin, Built With Aurelia shows you what is possible with Aurelia.</p>
            <p>The idea stemmed from there being no official source of who or what has been built with Aurelia. This site itself is built on Aurelia, it is using the Aurelia CLI and RequireJS, there are no 3rd party dependencies and the entire site is hosted on Github.</p>
