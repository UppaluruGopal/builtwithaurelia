            <h1>About Built With Aurelia</h1>
            <p>Built With Aurelia is a simplistic showcase of all the great things the Aurelia community are doing. Whether it be a website, mobile application or a plugin, Built With Aurelia shows you what is possible with Aurelia.</p>
            <p>The idea stemmed from there being no official source of who or what has been built with Aurelia. This site itself is built on Aurelia, built using the Aurelia CLI. The code is written using TypeScript, the site itself is hosted on Firebase, submissions are handled using Firebase Realtime Database and the site is served from a Firebase Cloud Function</p>
            <h1>Who built this?</h1>
            <p>The site is built and run by me <a href="http://dwaynecharrington.com">Dwayne Charrington</a>, a front-end engineer from Brisbane, Australia. I routinely blog about Aurelia over <a href="https://ilikekillnerds.com/">on my blog I Like Kill Nerds.</a></p>
